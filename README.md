School project using bit arrays for infinte Calculation and a self made Math parser for input.

## Features
- Constants (Last result, random, own constants using `vars` command)
- Solve expressions (Beta, currently by trying out)
- Calculate entire files
- Benchmark expressions
- Bitwise operators, pow
- Integer based arithmetic (postive + negative)
